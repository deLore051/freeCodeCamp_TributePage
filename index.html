                    <p id="introduction1">Nikola Tesla accomplished more in his lifetime than many of us could ever hope to achieve in a 100 lifetimes. 
                        Tesla held over 300 different patents, spanning several countries. From wireless technology to alternating current, electric motors, 
                        Radio, X-Rays, radar and laser technology…the list goes on.</p>
        
                    <p id="introduction2">Nikola Tesla’s work would go on to inspire thousands of inventors, dreamers and engineers. To this very day, his inventions continue 
                        to shape life as we know it. You can’t help but wonder what the world would have looked like today if Nikola Tesla would have been 
                        able to finish his experiments with free energy and long range wireless energy transfer.</p>

                               <strong>1859 Nikola Tesla is born.</strong><br/> Nikola Tesla is believed to have been born at midnight. During his birth, lightning 
                                struck during a summer storm. Born to a Serbian Family in Smiljan, Tesla was nicknamed `Child of the Storm`, by his aunt. 
                                That said, his mother replied to that comment by calling him `Child of the light`.

                                <strong>1870 Tesla's Brush With Death.</strong><br/> Nikola Tesla moved to a place known as Karlovac to complete his high school. 
                                Three years later, he went back to Smiljan and shortly after his arrival; he contracted cholera. He was in hospital for close 
                                to one year, and he faced near-death circumstances.

                                <strong>1875 Tesla Enrolls In College.</strong><br/> In 1875, Tesla enrolled to a Polytechnic based on a military scholarship. 
                                He was a disciplined student and achieved the highest grades possible while passing various exams. More so, he also started 
                                a cultural club and received a letter of commendation from the dean of the Technical Department.

                                <strong>1880 Tesla Moves To Prague To Study Philosophy.</strong><br/> Tesla’s uncle collected money to help him relocate to Prague to 
                                finish his studies. He arrived late to enroll for classes, and his lack of competence in Greek and Czech meant that he did not 
                                qualify for the classes he wanted to take. Instead, he took up classes in Philosophy at the university, though he did not receive 
                                grades for the courses.

                                <strong>1881 Tesla Begins His Career As Chief Electrical Engineer.</strong><br/> In 1881, he moved to Budapest in Hungary, to work for a 
                                telegraph company. Upon arriving, he noticed that the Budapest Telephone Exchange company was not in operation, so he worked at draftsman 
                                in another company. A few months later, the BTS Company was in operation, and he was given the position of chief electrical engineer. 
                                During his tenure, he introduced various operation upswings which improved the performance of the company.

                                <strong>1882 Tesla Goes To Work For Edison.</strong><br/> In 1882, he found another job in Paris with a company referred to as the 
                                Continental Edison Company. He began working in a new industry by installing indoor lighting resources. His company had several divisions, 
                                and he worked in the section of the company that was responsible for lighting systems. At this company, he improved his electrical 
                                engineering prowess. The management team noticed his abilities and soon introduced him as part of the team that would produce dynamos 
                                and motors. Following this, Tesla moved to New York in the USA. In 1884, one of his managers from Paris was relocated to the US to manage 
                                a company where he worked. During, this time, Tesla started a manufacturing division that was found in New York and sought for Tesla to 
                                be relocated to the country as well. In the same year, Tesla was relocated to the USA and started working immediately.

                                <strong>1885 Tesla Submits Some Of His First Patents.</strong><br/> In March 1885, he met with an attorney known as Lemuel Serrel, to help in 
                                the submission of various patents. Serrel introduced Tesla to various businessmen, including Benjamin Vail and Robert Lane. They agreed 
                                to help finance a new light production company under Tesla Name. Tesla worked to acquire the patents for the company including developing 
                                an enhanced DC motor. His solutions gained attention from the mass media who sought his solutions.

                                <strong>1887 Tesla Re-imagines The Electric Motor.</strong><br/> In 1887, Tesla came up with an induction motor that was operated by alternating 
                                current, a form of power that was becoming common in Europe and the USA. This type of power provided various benefits, especially in 
                                long-distance power transmission. In particular, the motor was operated by a polyphase current, which produced a rotating magnetic field 
                                to operate the motor. This innovative electric motor was patented in May 1988, and it comprised of a basic self-starting design that did not 
                                require the use of commutators. As a result, this reduced the occurrence of sparking the high maintenance that was associated with replacing 
                                mechanical brushes.

                                <strong>1890 Tesla Begins His Work On Wireless Power Transmission.</strong><br/> After 1890, Tesla researched various approaches to transmitting 
                                power by inductive and capacitive coupling. This was through the use of AC voltages that were produced by his famous `Tesla coil.` He tried 
                                in many ways to come up with a wireless lighting system that was based on near field and capacitative coupling. He even performed various 
                                public demonstrations, where he would light up Geissler tubes to impress his audience. Tesla also spent close to well over a decade trying 
                                to come up with new solutions for lighting.

                                <strong>1891 Tesla Patents The Tesla Coil.</strong><br/> In mid 1891, at the age of 35, he became a naturalized citizen of the US. In the same year, 
                                he also patented his famous Tesla Coil.

                                <strong>1943 Tesla's Death</strong><br/> In early 1943, at age 86, Tesla died in a Hotel Room in New York. He died alone, and his body was found by 
                                a maid who ignored a do not disturb sign on Tesla’s room. The assistant medical professional evaluated the body and determined the cause of 
                                death was related to coronary complications. A few days after the FBI ordered for the acquisition of his belongings, John G Trump was called 
                                in to evaluate his works. Trump was a well known electrical engineer who worked for the state, which was held in custody. Following a three 
                                day investigation, a Trumps report concluded that was nothing that would demonstrate a hazard in unfriendly circumstances.

                                <strong>Alternating Current</strong><br/> This is one of his first ever inventions that caused a stir at the 1893 Worlds Fair in Chicago. 
                                The resulting conclusion from Edison and Tesla`s argument on the distribution and production of electricity was provided. The argument 
                                could be summarized in relation to cost and safety factors. It was determined that the DC current produced by Edison was costly over long 
                                distances and it also produced sparks from the commutator. Edison and his proponents used various approaches to oppose Tesla`s Alternative 
                                Current as a solution. Edison tried to prove by going as far as electrocuting animals to prove his point. That said, Tesla responded by 
                                showing that AC was safe by shooting current through his body to produce light. This argument is regarded by most as the culmination of 
                                well over a decade of wrangles in terms of patents, corrupt deals and stolen ideas. Despite it all, this proves that the system developed 
                                by Tesla is effective at providing power in the modern era.

                                <strong>Modern Lighting</strong><br/> While Tesla did not invent light itself, he is responsible for the innovations that have been crucial in 
                                how it’s distributed and produced. He came up with fluorescent bulbs in his lab 40 years before they became a standard in the consumer market. 
                                More so, at the world`s fair, he used glass tubes by customizing them into the names of famous scientists, to create neon signs.

                                <strong>X-rays</strong><br/> Ionizing radio and electromagnetic technologies were common on research during early in the 1800s. However, 
                                Nikola Tesla went in depth by studying everything up until the Kirlian photography. This resource has the ability to observe life force, 
                                which is now common in medical diagnostics. It was a transformative piece of technology which Tesla was key in it`s development. Similar 
                                to many of his inventions, the inspiration for X-rays came from his belief that everything we need, is around us at all times.

                                <strong>Radio</strong><br/> It’s important to note that the Guglielmo Marconi is initially credited to be the inventor of the original radio 
                                technology. However, the Supreme Court denied his patent in 1943, when it was determined that Tesla originally built the radio years before. 
                                In particular, Radio signals occur naturally and require a transmitter and receiver to be used. This is a technique that Tesla demonstrated 
                                at a presentation in 1892 before the National Electric Light Association. Five years later, Tesla made a patent application. However, in 1904, 
                                the patents were overturned with the U.S patent office determining that Marconi was the original owner. This was mainly due to the backing 
                                that Marconi had and the state, which was afraid of paying royalties to Tesla.

                                <strong>Remote control</strong><br/> This particular invention was a natural development from the radio. The demonstration of this technology 
                                occurred in 1898 and it comprised of several huge batteries. Also, the demonstration included large radio controlled switches, a rudder, 
                                running light and a boat propeller. Although this technology remained dormant for a long time, it has played an important role in modern 
                                day society.

                                <strong>Electric motor</strong><br/> One of his greatest inventions has finally become popular by the car that brandishes his name. Although the 
                                technical aspects are beyond the scope of this summary, it is important to note that the invention of the motor was one Tesla`s exceptional 
                                inventions. In fact, the development of this motor could have helped in reducing the world`s dependency on oil. That said, this invention was 
                                compromised by the economic crisis in 1930 and the following world wars. All things considered, this technology has revolutionized the world 
                                in many ways.

                                <strong>Robotics</strong><br/> With his exceptional prowess in scientific concepts, Nikola Tesla came up with the idea that all people are 
                                inspired by external impulses. In fact, according to him, every thought and act, was inspired by external stimuli. As a result, he came 
                                up with the concept of robotics. That said, an aspect of humanity was still present, with Tesla claiming the human replicas have limitations 
                                including growth and procreation. Nevertheless, Tesla worked with all his information to come up with practical solutions. Some of his visions 
                                for the future including robotic companions, use of sensors, autonomous systems and intelligent vehicles.

                                <strong>Lasers</strong><br/> Tesla is also believed to have played a major role in the invention of the laser. Lasers have played an important 
                                role in various medical procedures such as surgery. Besides that, the laser has also been key in the development of digital media. That said, 
                                his invention of the laser is a classical example of crossing into the worlds of science fiction. The main paradox here being that laser 
                                energy can be beneficial for the society and potentially dangerous at the same time. Lasers are still evolving and most techniques are based 
                                on the research by Tesla.

                                <strong>Wireless Communications and Limitless Free Energy</strong><br/> These two technologies are directly linked and they can have a significant 
                                impact in our daily lives. J.P Morgan gave Tesla the funding to develop a technology that would leverage the occurrence of natural frequencies 
                                in the universe to transmit data. This includes a broad range of information that could be communicated including voice messages, text and 
                                images. This represented the world’s first communication resources, but it also showed that there was a worldwide technology that could be used 
                                to connect the entire world.

                                <strong>Long-Range Wireless Energy Transfer</strong><br/> Tesla was researching how energy could be transferred wireless by using his accumulated 
                                knowledge on microwaves and radio. This also involved the creation of the Tesla Coil and magnifying transmitter. Tesla wanted to come up with 
                                a system where energy could be transmitted through long distances. To achieve this goal, he developed the Wardenclyffe Tower in Shoreham, 
                                Long Island. The role of this island was to function as wireless telecommunications resources and transmit electrical power. That said, 
                                JP Morgan who funded the development of the tower finally cut down the funding for the same. Since he was unable to find any additional 
                                financiers, he was inclined to stop the development of the tower. As a result, he was never able to achieve his goal of transmitting energy 
                                worldwide.

                                <strong>Death ray</strong><br/> Early in the 1930s, Tesla claimed to have come with a particle beam weapon. Theoretically speaking, this device 
                                would have been able of producing an intense and focused beam of energy. This energy could be sent across great distances to destroy armies, 
                                warplanes and more. Tesla advertised his technologies to various militaries all over the world, but never found the best financiers. According 
                                to Tesla, efforts had been made to steal the invention. His room was invaded, and his papers were scrutinized, but the perpetrators never found 
                                anything worth value.

                                <strong>Tesla’s Oscillator</strong><br/> In 1898, Tesla claimed to have developed and launched a small oscillating device that, when attached to 
                                a building, would shake it almost destroying everything around it. This device could essentially produce the same power as an earthquake. 
                                Upon realizing the potential side effects of owning such a technology, he informed his staff to destroy the technology. Some theorists still 
                                believe that the government continues to use his research in places such as the HAARP facility.

                                <strong>Free Electricity System</strong><br/> With financing from J.P Morgan, Tesla developed the Wardenclyffe Tower. This was a gigantic wireless 
                                transmission station that was found in New York in the early nineties. Morgan believed the Tower could transmit wireless resources all over the 
                                world. That said, Tesla had other plans. He intended to send messages, images and telephony all across the Atlantic to the UK. This would even 
                                be related to ships at sea based on his concepts of leveraging the Earth to conduct signals. If the project was successful, anyone could gain 
                                access to electricity, by simply inserting a rode into the ground. That said, free electricity is not profitable. This system could have serious 
                                ramifications for the energy supply in the world and Morgan refused to finance it.

                                <strong>Improved Airships</strong><br/> Tesla proposed that ships which were electrically powered could help in transporting passengers from 
                                New York to London in less than 4 hours. The airships would travel eight miles above the ground, and he also believed that the airships might 
                                source their power from the atmosphere. This would reduce the need to refuel, and the ships might be used to transport passengers to pre-chosen 
                                locations. He was never validated for his invention, and we nowadays have drones flying based on his work as inspiration.
